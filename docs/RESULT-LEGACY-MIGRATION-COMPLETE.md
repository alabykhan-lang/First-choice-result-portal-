# Result Legacy Migration Complete

## Completed

- Result login no longer accepts legacy browser passwords or first-password
  setup.
- Result sessions are accepted only through the server-managed HttpOnly cookie.
- The browser no longer sends Result table requests to the Supabase Data API.
- Legacy database helper names fail closed when called without the central
  session boundary.
- The prior transitional Result emergency gate was retired from Supabase; it
  is no longer an authentication or legacy-access authority source.
- The Result UI no longer exposes Legacy Login, Register, invite rotation or
  browser role changes. Result account and scope administration is performed
  in Central Registry.
- The browser no longer persists Result settings or credential-like values in
  localStorage. Navigation state in sessionStorage is display state only.
- Result reads, writes, publishing, report-card authorization and exports use
  protected server actions.
- The nine high-risk Result tables have individual RLS migrations and reviewed
  rollback SQL in the Central Registry repository.
- The shared permission catalog now contains the exact Result contract,
  including `traits.enter`, `results.unpublish`, `result_users.manage` and
  `result_settings.manage`.

## Remaining compatibility

- The old Result database functions remain in the database for controlled
  rollback and server adapters; their inputs still require a validated session
  where exposed.
- Report-card markup, calculations and PDF rendering remain in the browser after
  protected data retrieval.
- Central Registry management and record adapters use the host-only session
  cookie. School Platform workspace sign-in also uses a server-issued
  HttpOnly cookie; opaque client credentials are not stored in the browser.
- Provider-key/OCR processing requires a server-side provider configuration and
  is not enabled from browser storage.

No identity, student, class, score, permission grant, scope assignment or
academic record was created by this migration.
