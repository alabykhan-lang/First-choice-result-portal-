# Result RLS Rollout

The Result Portal uses protected server-side APIs for all sensitive Result data.
The shared Supabase migration enables RLS table by table and removes browser
privileges from the legacy Result tables. The active policy is intentionally
deny-by-default; the server adapters enforce identity, employment, grant,
permission, class, subject, academic-session and term checks before reading or
writing data.

See the Central Registry migration directory for the per-table migrations,
`result_boundary_hardening` for the final permission/legacy-authority gate, and
`supabase/rollback/RESULT-RLS-ROLLBACK.sql` plus
`supabase/rollback/RESULT-BOUNDARY-HARDENING-ROLLBACK.sql` for reviewed rollback
references.

The management visibility correction is recorded in
`20260805000000_central_management_permission_gate.sql`. It adds the protected
Result-to-Central management capability check and idempotently restores the
canonical permission on the existing approved primary management grant.

## Live rollout record

The following Result tables are enabled with RLS and have no anonymous or
authenticated table privileges: `user_profiles`, `invite_codes`, `settings`,
`published_subjects`, `scores`, `remarks`, `traits`, `fees` and `students`.
Each has a deny-by-default browser policy; protected server adapters are the
approved read/write path. The live migration sequence is recorded by Supabase
under the table-specific `result_rls_*` versions and the final
`result_boundary_hardening` migration.

The final hardening migration did not add data, identities, roles or scopes. It
added only permission definitions, session-native workspace access and
fail-closed legacy mutation guards. The management correction updated one
existing approved grant only; it did not create a grant or change any Result
grant.

The table-by-table RLS rollout is complete for the nine prioritised Result
tables. Protected endpoint contracts pass, production row counts remain
unchanged, and the authorised super-administrator completed the required
non-destructive production verification. PKCE SSO is now ready for its next
separate implementation phase; PKCE itself is not enabled by this rollout.
