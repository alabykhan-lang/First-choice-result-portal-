# Result Rollback Plan

This phase adds authorization functions, context-aware scope adapters, a
credential-management adapter, a session-cookie exchange route and Result
application routes. It does not copy, transform or delete Result records and
creates no sample records.

The additive database migrations are:

- `result_protected_reads_scopes_and_session_revocation`
- `result_api_grants_and_scope_management`
- `identity_credential_management_adapter`
- `central_session_cookie_adapters`
- `central_management_session_adapters`
- `result_permission_catalog_contract`
- `result_rls_user_profiles`
- `result_rls_invite_codes`
- `result_rls_settings`
- `result_rls_published_subjects`
- `result_rls_scores`
- `result_rls_remarks`
- `result_rls_traits`
- `result_rls_fees`
- `result_rls_students`
- `scope_privilege_cleanup`
- `result_boundary_hardening` (permission catalog additions, exact permission
  checks, legacy mutation guards and the session-native workspace adapter)
- `20260805000000_central_management_permission_gate` (server-derived Result
  management visibility, Central Registry management-session gate and an
  idempotent restoration of the existing approved canonical permission)

## Application rollback

1. Stop central Result sign-in and protected writes through the deployment
   rollback mechanism.
2. Redeploy the last known-good Result build if an operational regression is
   confirmed.
3. Keep the database functions and session table in place while investigating;
   they are additive and do not change existing Result rows.
4. Do not restore direct account, invite or publish writes automatically. If an
   emergency compatibility release needs a grant restored, record approval,
   scope and expiry first.

## Database rollback

The reviewed table-level RLS rollback reference is maintained at
`central-registry/supabase/rollback/RESULT-RLS-ROLLBACK.sql`. It must only be
used for the affected table after confirming the protected deployment is
stopped. It is not a normal compatibility path and must not restore unrestricted
browser authority.

The final boundary rollback reference is
`central-registry/supabase/rollback/RESULT-BOUNDARY-HARDENING-ROLLBACK.sql`.
It removes only the new session adapter/guards and unused catalog definitions
after dependency checks; it intentionally does not restore legacy browser
credentials, role mutation, invite rotation or direct Data API access.

The management correction is reversible without touching Result records:

1. Confirm the existing primary management grant and its audit history.
2. If rollback is approved, remove only the appended
   `central_registry.administer` value from that same existing grant, preserving
   every other permission and grant field.
3. Revoke or redeploy the affected application routes together so the Result
   link remains fail-closed.
4. Re-run the focused management contracts and confirm the Result data counts.

Do not delete the existing identity, grant, audit row, students, scores or
other academic records as part of this rollback.

- Do not drop `school_identity_sessions` or the new functions as an immediate
  reaction. Existing active sessions must first be expired or revoked through a
  controlled server operation.
- The migration files are additive. A future down migration, if required, must
  be reviewed against live function dependencies and audit history.
- Never restore or expose password values, hashes or raw session secrets during
  rollback.
- Never hard-delete Result users or students as part of rollback. User removal
  remains a Central Registry deprovisioning operation; student removal remains
  an archive operation in the protected path.
- If the Central Registry frontend is rolled back, revoke any newly issued
  session rows through the existing session revocation path; do not expose the
  cookie secret or restore browser trust of roles.

## Verification after rollback

Check that the Result home page, class loading, score reads, existing report-card
generation and production data counts match the pre-release baseline. Run the
unauthenticated contract tests and confirm that no new session or audit rows
were created by the test run.
